## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project aims to develop software that can encrypt/decrypt the text and file and store the output using three different algorithms.

We built web-based application using HTML and CSS, and app-based software using JAVA.

## Technologies <a name = "technologies"></a>
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [HTML]
* [CSS]
* [Java]

**App-based Java application** 

## üöÄ Demo <a name = "demo"></a>

Follow this [web link] for the web-based application. 

Follow installation instrucction to run java application.

## Installation <a name = "installation"></a>
***
Just need to install [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb121/nb121.html)to run the java application.  

Note: Upload CryptKeeper file to run the application
